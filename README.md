## Use cases
DecentralAds serves as a bridge between software houses, sponsors, and gamers, facilitating the connection between the various players in the video game industry.

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trumanfun/DecentralAds/main/presentation/Presentation_03.png)

It enables the integration of customizable dNFTs, called DAd, within video games. These can be given to advertisers and software houses or offered to fans through lotteries. The distinguishing feature is the ability for owners to freely edit the metadata associated with their DAds, trade or resell them, offering a unique feature in the context of in-game advertising.

The goal for this hackathon was to get to the point of building an MVP that would allow one to:
- Create game contracts containing the DAds
- List the DAds to be inserted into the video game
- Insert DAds into the Unity video game
- Purchase DAds for sale
- Participate in lotteries
- Redeem reserved or won DAds
- Modify the metadata of DAds
- Withdraw earnings

## Future plans for DecentralAds
The project presented in this hackathon is actually just the beginning.

The goal is to transform DecentralAds into a startup ready to bring innovation to the gaming market.

Future developments will include:
- Implementation of a customizable environment for each DAd
- Support for different formats for DAds, not just banners
- Deployment of an integration package for all game engines
- On-chain reporting of DAd retention in the game
- Integration of a CPM system, where multiple images can be linked to a DAd, and the one to be displayed will be selected based on the player and their preferences expressed through digital identity
